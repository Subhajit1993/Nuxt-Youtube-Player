# YoutubeClone

> My classy universal Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```

### Project Details
1. Created using PWA guidelines
2. All the requests to youtube api are cached so that app will work with slow and faulty network
3. Replace the youtube `api_key` field in `index.vue` with your own api key
